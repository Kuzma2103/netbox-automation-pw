# Introduction

This project is an automation testing framework built using Playwright for netbox web application.
The framework is designed to facilitate the testing of web application with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and detailed reporting.
It implements best practices such as the Page Object Model (POM), reusable helpers, and step tracking with test.step for clear test execution flow.

The primary objective of this project is to streamline the process of creating, validating, and managing automated tests while providing detailed insights into test execution through robust reporting.
